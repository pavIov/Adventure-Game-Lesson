# Welcome to Dungeon Digit
> A small game I made in Python Turtle for programming class

## HOW TO RUN

* Make sure you have the Turtle module installed in Python
* Copy/download the code from MainGame.py
* You're all set
> If you have the Turtle module installed (which comes pre-installed with IDLE), it should be that simple. If you have any issues running the code, let me know

## INSTRUCTIONS 

You are stuck in an old dungeon that is ridded with mines that will all explode in 5 minutes. 

To escape: 

* Find 5 numbers hidden accross the dungeon
* Find the hidden keycard to access the final door
* Ender your 5-digit code into the mine terminal
* Disable the mines in the terminal
* Get to the fire exit (the red door), and win

 
 ğŸŸ§ Orange = you
 the player
 
 ğŸŸª Purple = the mine terminal 
 > don't even touch it until you get all the numbers 
 
 âšªGray = the minefield
 > Don't come close to it until you disable the mines 
 
 ğŸŸ© Green = Keycard
 > use it to open the final door 
 
 ğŸŸ¥ Red = Exit
